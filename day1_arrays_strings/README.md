# Day 1 - String to Array & Array Operations

This project demonstrates how to convert a string into an array and perform basic array operations using JavaScript. It covers essential array manipulation techniques that are foundational for working with data in web development.

## Features

- **Convert to Array**: Converts a paragraph string into an array of words.
- **Remove Word at Index**: Removes a word from the array at a specified index.
- **Insert Words**: Inserts one or more words at a specified position in the array.
- **Dynamic Result Display**: Shows the updated array after each operation.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — Contains the HTML layout and user input fields.
- `style.css` — Styles the page for a clean and user-friendly interface.
- `app.js` — Implements the JavaScript logic for array operations and DOM updates.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. Click **Convert to Array** to transform the paragraph into an array of words.
3. To remove a word, enter the word's index and click **Remove Word at Index**.
4. To insert words, specify the index and enter words (comma-separated), then click **Insert Words**.
5. See the results update in real-time below the controls.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding how strings can be converted to arrays.
- Learning to manipulate arrays using JavaScript methods like `splice()`.
- Practicing DOM manipulation to show dynamic results.
