    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p id="paragraph">
      My name is Tushar Saini, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology degree at NSUT. Over the past few
      years, I have realized the importance of consistent learning and self-discipline in shaping a successful career
      in technology. While I feel I have lost some valuable time earlier in my college life, I am now fully committed
      to making the most out of the remaining years by focusing deeply on backend development and related modern web
      technologies.

      I have a strong passion for programming, especially JavaScript and Node.js, and I am continuously working on
      real projects to sharpen my skills. I believe hands-on experience is the best teacher, and I am dedicated to
      building secure, scalable, and efficient applications. My learning approach combines structured plans with
      practical experimentation, helping me not only understand concepts but also apply them effectively.

      Sharing my journey on platforms like LinkedIn and Instagram is an important part of my growth. It helps me stay
      accountable, connect with like-minded developers, and contribute to the community by sharing insights and
      progress. I strive to create content that is educational, relatable, and sometimes even fun, as I believe
      learning should never be boring.

      Beyond coding, I am focused on personal growth â€” building confidence, time management skills, and a strong work
      ethic. I understand the value of perseverance, and I am motivated by the vision of a successful career where I
      can solve real-world problems and contribute meaningfully to the tech industry.

      Looking ahead, I am excited about exploring advanced backend concepts such as authentication with JWT, efficient
      data management with Redis, and deployment strategies with tools like Docker and NGINX. My goal is to become a
      highly skilled backend developer, capable of building robust systems that power modern applications.

      Every day is a new opportunity to learn and improve, and I am committed to making these years count. Through
      discipline, continuous effort, and a passion for technology, I am confident I will reach my goals and create a
      fulfilling professional journey.
