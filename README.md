# 💻 60-Day Backend Development Challenge

Welcome to my **60-day journey to becoming a skilled backend developer**! This challenge documents my daily progress, mini-projects, and learnings—starting from the basics (like strings, arrays, and JS logic) to advanced backend topics such as authentication, databases, caching, reverse proxies, deployment, and more.
